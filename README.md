# Analysis code for the Norwegian insect monitoring

This is a record of the analyses in the yearly reports from the Norwegian insect monitoring program (NorIns). The reports, a data display-app and more information on the project can be found at https://www.nina.no/Naturmangfold/Insekter/Overv%C3%A5king-av-insekter 

The code for the reports are often extensive (at least in length) and is presented here in a bare-bone fashion, with most functions documented in the Norimon R-package https://github.com/NINAnor/Norimon

This repo also includes (to be included) a basic recipe for downloading the dataset from GBIF and "unpacking" it into a more workable format.
